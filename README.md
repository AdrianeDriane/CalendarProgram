## Final Programming Project in Java: Calendar Program

This program takes month, date and year from user input and prints whether it's
a holiday or a regular day in the Philippines. This was made by Ralph Adriane P. Dilao,
a 12th Grade student in the University of Cebu - SHS Main Campus

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder that contains the source code
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
